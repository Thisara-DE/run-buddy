## Purpose
A website that offers fitness training services.

* Added shadows with the text-shadow and box-shadow properties.
* Made elements transparent using rgba() values and opacity.
* Made the header sticky while accounting for Safari support with the -webkit- vendor prefix.
* Styled different states of an element using pseudo-classes like :hover.
* Visualized layouts as parent/child relationships and used wireframing to determine what I needed to do.
* Created scalable page layouts with flexbox properties.
* Adjusted layouts so that they take up more horizontal space than vertical space.
* Replaced the CSS floats with flexbox to create a more fluid layout.
* Applied media queries to accommodate multiple screen sizes and devices.
* Enhanced the visuals of the webpage with advanced CSS tricks such as pseudo-classes.
